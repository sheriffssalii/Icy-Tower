# Icy Tower – Computer Graphics Project

This project is a 2D implementation of the classic **Icy Tower** game, developed as part of the **Computer Graphics** course.  
The game demonstrates core graphics concepts such as texture mapping, transformations, camera scrolling, and real-time interaction using OpenGL.
